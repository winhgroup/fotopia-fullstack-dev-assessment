# Fotopia Fullstack Developer Assessment

This test assess your fullstack abilities. 

## Idea ##
* You have a search bar which accepts any string from the user. 
* Your frontend code should call the backend restfull API and send the input string to it.
* The backend service will search for all products which are similar to the input string.

## Rules ##
* You can use any frontend library/framework (AngularJS, ReactJS, etc.).
* You must use Node JS for your backend restful service.
* You should use Mongo DB for your database to retrieve the products from it (you can use Mongoose npm package).

## Steps ## 

* Fork this repo then clone it. Or you can just download it as a zip file and send it back to us when you are ready.
* Setup the required packages on your machine.
* Load the provided Json file to your MongoDB to use it (Products.json).
* Create a Node JS restfull API.
* Create a frontend application.
* Test then send your fullstack solution. If you forked this repo, just commit and push your changes and we will see the updates.
